= Validation of AsciiDoc files
:description: The AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ validates cross-references and attributes.
:navtitle: Validation of files

{description}

== How the plugin can help with validation

The IDE can validate, for example, cross-references and attribute names for a set of AsciiDoc files.
It will also provide auto-completion for attribute names and references.

To do this, all files need to be in one project.

If the IDE opens a single file and not a project with all related files, it might show validation errors where it shouldn't.

== Validation of source code snippets

For source code with a specified language, the IDE will inject the language context and will show validation errors.

[,java]
----
System.out.println("Hello, world!");
----

In the plugin's settings, a user can hide errors in source blocks for all languages, or for specific languages.

To prevent this on individual code blocks, add the option `novalidate` to the source block.
This option is a non-standard AsciiDoc option and specific to the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ.

NOTE: This is available since plugin version 0.43.3.

.Adding the `novalidate` option to the beginning
[source,asciidoc]
-----
[%novalidate,java]
----
System.out.println("Hello, world!");
----
-----

.Adding the `novalidate` option to the `opts` attributes
[source,asciidoc]
-----
[,java,opts=novalidate]
----
System.out.println("Hello, world!");
----
-----

Add the `opts=novalidate` using an intent in the editor by pressing [.windows.linux]#kbd:[Alt+Enter]# [.macos]#kbd:[⌥ ↩]# and choosing *Hide errors in source blocks for this block*.

NOTE: This is available since plugin version 0.43.3. The intent is available from 0.43.4.

== How to edit files as a project

The user selects the menu item menu:File[Open...], then selects the folder and opens it.
The IDE will open files in the folder and its sub-folder as one project.
Validation and auto-completion then works as expected.

If the user opens the dialog to open a single file, the file will not be part of a project.
The IDE can then only provide a sub-set of auto-completion and validation.

== Further reading

If files are in separate distinct folders and still belong together, the user can group them into one project.
See chapter xref:features/advanced/multimodule.adoc[] for more information.
