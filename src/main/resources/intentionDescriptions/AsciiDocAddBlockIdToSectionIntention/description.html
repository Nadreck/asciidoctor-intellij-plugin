Add the ID of the section explicitly as a block ID.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>AsciiDoc provides an automatically generated ID for each section that can an anchor can reference.
    When the text in the section changes, the automatically generated ID changes as well. To provide stable anchor ID,
    the ID should be explicit and should not change when section header changes.
